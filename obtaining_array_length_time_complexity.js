// The time complexity for obtaining the length of an array is O(1), 
// which means it takes a constant amount of time, regardless of the size of the array.

// This is because the length of an array is stored as a property of the array object, 
// so accessing it does not require iterating through the entire array. Therefore, 
// the time required to obtain the length of an array is constant and does not depend on the size of the array.
