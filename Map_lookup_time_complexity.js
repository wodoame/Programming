/*
The time complexity of obtaining an item from a Map or HashMap is O(1) on average. 
This means that the time it takes to access an item in a Map or HashMap does not increase with the size of the Map or HashMap.
In the worst case, however, the time complexity of obtaining an item from a Map or HashMap is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the Map or HashMap.
This can occur when there are hash collisions or when the hash function used by the Map or HashMap is poorly designed, causing a large number of collisions. 
However, these situations are rare in practice, and the amortized time complexity for obtaining an item from a Map or HashMap is still O(1).
